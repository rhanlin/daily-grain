# Quickstart: Backlog Sync Verification

## Setup
Ensure you have multiple categories and tasks (some with subtasks, some without) on the Home page.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Standalone Tasks**: Create a task with no subtasks. Verify it appears in the Daily Plan Backlog.
2.  **Rename Category**: Change a category name on the Home page. Navigate to Daily Plan. Verify the Backlog slide header reflects the new name instantly.
3.  **Delete/Archive**: Archive a category. Verify it and its tasks are immediately removed from the Backlog.
4.  **Edit Task Title**: Modify a task title in the Category Detail page. Verify the Backlog slide reflects the update immediately.
